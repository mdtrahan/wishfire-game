# Tests DOX

## Purpose
- Own regression contracts, ownership-boundary proofs, fixture parity, and targeted runtime behavior tests.
- Make historically fragile behavior explicit and repeatable.

## Ownership
- `*.test.js` files use Node's built-in test runner for contracts and static/runtime checks.
- `*.spec.js` files cover browser-style flows where present.
- `fixtures/` owns deterministic CSV cases shared by JS and Rust/WASM tests.

## Local Contracts
- Story-entry checks exercise the shared layout registry and transition controller: deny early navigation, preserve pagination, hand off at the authored marker or Skip, stop Auto in combat, and retain Town recovery. Browser QA must exercise the visible Canvas controls too.
- Tests are often the clearest owner of regression-prone behavior. Read the relevant test before changing gameplay, rendering, persistence, or SimulationCore code.
- Prefer focused deterministic tests over broad suite runs during development.
- Static source assertions are allowed in this repo when they protect architecture boundaries, but avoid adding brittle source-shape checks when behavior can be tested directly.
- Full `npm test` may include unrelated legacy/static failures; report focused validation scope honestly.
- Do not weaken an ownership contract to make an implementation pass unless the product/architecture source changed too.

## Work Guidance
- Name new tests after the behavior or contract, not the implementation detail alone.
- For bug/regression beads, add the smallest test that fails for the old behavior and protects the intended owner.
- Update fixture tests and CSV data together.
- Keep helper extraction inside tests small; if helpers become shared, move them deliberately.

## Verification
- `node --test tests/<file>.test.js`
- `npm test` only when broad validation is needed and expected to be meaningful.
- Browser/Playwright checks only for behavior that cannot be covered deterministically.
- `tests/uiPresentationLockGateContract.test.js` protects the rendered gate command, viewport matrix, rejection mode, evidence inventory, and staged-path routing. The browser gate supplies the behavioral proof for those static seams.

## Child DOX Index
- `tests/fixtures/AGENTS.md` - deterministic CSV fixtures and JS/Rust parity data.

- Story entry proof covers map-only startup, town hit gating, first-page preservation, Skip, authored combat handoff, and Town recovery.

- Quest flow tests replace direct story-to-Town recovery expectations with ladder completion and Continue/Quit; gallery/map Back routes now return to the quest ladder.
