## Reports
- (append newest report at top)
- bead id: ORKA-fp9
- summary of changes: Hardened enemy debuff lifecycle by normalizing debuff state on read, unifying apply/decay paths through a single helper, sanitizing invalid/duplicate slot data, and preserving deterministic slot eviction behavior.
- files modified: Scripts/functionBank.js; web-runner/modules/functionBank.js; tests/debuffLifecycleReliabilityContract.test.js
- test evidence: `npm test -- tests/debuffLifecycleReliabilityContract.test.js` (2/2 pass); `npm test -- tests/traitHookFrameworkContract.test.js tests/blueBuffLifecycleContract.test.js` (4/4 pass)
- scope confirmation: Changes are confined to debuff apply/stack/expire/cleanup reliability for ORKA-fp9 with mirrored runtime maintenance only.
