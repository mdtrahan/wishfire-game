# Insights / Decisions Log

## 2026-02-18
- Consolidated operational memory files to restore signal over noise.
- Decisions made:
  - Reduced `ai-memory/todo.md` to one completed sync task plus one active waiting item.
  - Pruned completed-task history to a short recent slice instead of a full transcript.
  - Reframed this log as decision-only records (no repetitive run-status entries).
- Files touched:
  - `ai-memory/todo.md`
  - `ai-memory/insights.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`
- Next task:
  - Await next explicit user request.

- Advanced Dev intake to TASK-004 after governance sync confirmed TASK-003 closure.
- Decisions made:
  - Confirmed sprint-board marks `TASK-003` complete and `TASK-004` as active feature allocation.
  - Confirmed no new unmapped BLOCKER/CRITICAL entries requiring triage stop.
  - Updated `ACTIVE.md` to set active task to `TASK-004` with a Phase 1-only Dev Next Action.
  - Updated `TASK-004-execution-plan.md` scope to turn-state authority + snapshot schema + deterministic checkpoints + instrumentation only, with explicit exclusions preserved.
- Files touched:
  - `governance/execution/dev-directives/ACTIVE.md`
  - `governance/execution/dev-directives/TASK-004-execution-plan.md`
  - `ai-memory/todo.md`
  - `ai-memory/insights.md`
- Next task:
  - Await next explicit user request.

## 2026-02-19
- Executed PM closure lock for TASK-003 and next-task promotion.
- Decisions made:
  - Marked TASK-003 complete in sprint board based on recorded Code Review PASS and closure evidence artifacts.
  - Removed stale pending-closure language from remediation log and synchronized resolved ADV mapping statements.
  - Promoted TASK-004 out of backlog into active sprint feature allocation; backlog now starts at TASK-005.
- Files touched:
  - `governance/planning/sprint-board.md`
  - `governance/execution/remediation-log.md`
  - `governance/planning/backlog.md`
  - `ai-memory/todo.md`
