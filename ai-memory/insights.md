# Insights / Decisions Log

## 2026-02-19
- Agile reset applied:
  - Removed verbose TODO-output enforcement blocks from `AGENTS.md`.
  - Reworked backlog into a cleaner Agile queue.
  - Remapped `TASK-005` to speed-buff removal scope (remove SPD blue-buff path, speed icon, and 5th slot; keep `ATK/DEF/MAG/RES`).
- Backed up `AGENTS.md` before this edit: `AGENTS.md.bak-2026-02-19-agile-reset`.
- Index gap: `ai-memory/PROJECT_INDEX.md` missing.
- Next: Await next explicit user request.
