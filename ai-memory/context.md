# Project Context (stable)

## Project
- HTML5 game repo.
- Primary goal: ship features incrementally without losing decisions across sessions.

## Working rules
- Single-task focus: one todo item per Codex run.
- Prefer minimal changes over refactors unless the todo explicitly requests it.

## Output expectations
- When coding: edit the minimum files needed.
- When uncertain: write a TODO item instead of guessing.

## Definitions
- "Checkpoint" = todo updated + insights appended (dated) + list of files touched.
