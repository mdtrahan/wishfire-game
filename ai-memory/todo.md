# TODO

## Queue (top is next)
- [x] Agile reset: remove verbose TODO logging mandates and remap TASK-005 to speed-buff removal scope.
- [ ] Await next explicit user request.

## Done (recent)
- [x] Add PM urgency/throughput governance so Lead dispatches bundled work packets and pre-stages next task.
- [x] Harden AGENTS.md to require pre-execution TODO declaration before agents begin work.
- [x] Sync and dispatch validation: confirm TASK-004 Phase 2 directives remain current and TASK-005 stays backlog-only.
- [x] Validate TASK-004 Phase 2 implementation conformance (checkpoint emissions + post-resume validation ordering) with protected-file constraints intact.
- [x] Enforce strict TODO output template in AGENTS.md to stop non-checkbox status replies.
