# TODO

## Queue (top is next)
- [x] Inventory repo structure and key gameplay loop files.
- [x] Add a deterministic debug snapshot output for testing.
- [x] Implement <next feature you want>. (placeholder closed; requires explicit user feature request)
- [x] Execute Phase 1 for TASK-004: turn-state contract + deterministic invariant predicates.
- [ ] Await next explicit user request.

## Done
- [x] Inventory repo structure and key gameplay loop files.
- [x] Add a deterministic debug snapshot output for testing.
- [x] Implement <next feature you want>. (placeholder closed; requires explicit user feature request)
- [x] Create governance directory scaffold and markdown files requested by user.
- [x] Add governance/product folder with retention, monetization, and liveops docs.
- [x] Create governance audit report placeholder: 2026-Layout-Harness-Conformance-Report.md.
- [x] Execute sprint triage for ADV-2026 findings and allocate remediation within 30% cap.
- [x] Re-run sprint triage execution for ADV-2026 findings and confirm cap/backlog/remediation alignment.
- [x] Add milestone extension and DoD additions to milestone-definition.md.
- [x] Evaluate milestone progress coverage and propose next feature tasks.
- [x] Apply sprint containment: select one feature task, preserve 70/30 split, defer remaining feature tasks to backlog.
- [x] Refine TASK-004 scope to deterministic turn-state/snapshot validation only and exclude transition policy/refactor scope.
- [x] Define deterministic turn-state invariants for TASK-004 preconditions.
- [x] Execute Phase 1 for TASK-004: turn-state contract + deterministic invariant predicates.
