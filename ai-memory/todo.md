# TODO

## Queue (top is next)
- [x] Resolve cron sweep drift: fix post-role-switch authority label and add invariants artifact pre-check guidance.
- [ ] Await next explicit user request.

## Done (recent)
- [x] Close TASK-004 at PM layer and promote TASK-005 into active sprint feature allocation.
- [x] Agile reset: remove verbose TODO logging mandates and remap TASK-005 to speed-buff removal scope.
- [x] Add PM urgency/throughput governance so Lead dispatches bundled work packets and pre-stages next task.
- [x] Harden AGENTS.md to require pre-execution TODO declaration before agents begin work.
- [x] Sync and dispatch validation: confirm TASK-004 Phase 2 directives remain current and TASK-005 stays backlog-only.
