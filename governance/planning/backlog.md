## Deferred Adversarial Findings (Sprint X Triage)

### Theme: Transition target mismatch / layout registration integrity
- ADV-2026-002 (High)
  - Rationale: Deferred due to 30% remediation cap; selected Critical ADV-2026-001 for current sprint slot.
  - Milestone Alignment: Pending (milestone-definition.md is currently empty).

### Theme: Turn-model snapshot authority mismatch
- ADV-2026-003 (High)
  - Rationale: Deferred due to 30% remediation cap; selected Critical ADV-2026-001 for current sprint slot.
  - Milestone Alignment: Pending (milestone-definition.md is currently empty).

### Theme: Non-deterministic combat bootstrap
- ADV-2026-004 (Medium)
  - Rationale: Deferred due to cap and lower severity than selected item.
  - Milestone Alignment: Pending (milestone-definition.md is currently empty).

## Deferred Feature Tasks (Sprint Containment)
- TASK-003 Define and enforce transition contract matrix (allowed transitions, registered targets, rejection telemetry) to remove silent layout-change failures and enforce transition atomicity.
- TASK-005 Add deterministic transition scenario suite (fixed-seed bootstrap plus transition/resume assertions) mapped to milestone Definition of Done criteria.
