# Roadmap

## Now (Sprint X)
- Deliver deterministic transition governance for combat layout loop:
  - `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1`
  - suspend/resume assertion coverage at transition boundaries
- Active item: `TASK-006` (staging packet in `ACTIVE.md`)

## Next
- `TASK-007` End-of-turn gem refill reliability
- `TASK-008` Job-skill framework + enemy board-manipulation skills

## After
- `TASK-009` Map button routes to dedicated overworld layout (non-modal, pannable)
- `TASK-010` Tower war-beacon weekly faction cycle

## Governance Rule
- Completed layout-containment items remain as closed history; roadmap focus moves forward to deterministic systems and new feature delivery.
