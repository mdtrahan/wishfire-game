# Sprint X

## Feature Allocation (70%)
- TASK-004 Define authoritative turn-state source of truth, suspend/resume snapshot structure, and deterministic post-resume validation checkpoints; instrument validation only, with no transition contract enforcement, no layout registration policy changes, and no atomic transition queue refactors.

## Remediation Allocation (30%)
- REM-2026-001 (Linked ADV-2026-001) - Harness boot sequence reaches runtime loop, input bindings, and tick start in harness mode.

Capacity Rule:
Remediation must not exceed 30% unless Critical.

Allocation Check:
- Planned sprint split: Feature 70% / Remediation 30%
- Cap status: Remediation at 30% (within cap; no override required)
