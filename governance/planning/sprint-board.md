# Sprint X

## Sprint Goal
- Keep primary flow stable and ship modular enemy job-skill framework work without reopening cleared QA paths.

## Team Scrum Board
- [x] TASK-008 (Lead/Dev) - Enemy job-skill framework + `Drain Buff`, `X Out`, `Wipe` with deterministic refill sequencing and buff-only outcomes. (Lead PASS 2026-02-20)
- [x] TASK-009 (Lead/Dev) - Map layout routing + corrective packet closure. (Lead PASS 2026-02-20)
- [x] TASK-011 (Lead/Dev) - Legacy test-pipeline cleanup closed with approved archive/flush set and rollback manifest. (Lead PASS 2026-02-20)
- [x] TASK-012/013/014 Bundle (Lead/Dev) - One-cycle asset-prune closeout complete: manifest -> approved deletion -> validation+rollback. (Lead PASS 2026-02-20)
- [ ] TASK-015 (Lead/Dev) - Story card slot output-only UI: mirror exact latest combat debug/action line (single live line, no cache/stack), with lightweight placeholder animation.
- [ ] TASK-010 (Lead/Dev) - BLOCKED: waiting on art-team map update and required tower/war assets.
- [ ] REM-2026-001 (Lead/Dev) - Harness boot remediation remains active at remediation cap.

## WIP Limit

- Remediation: 1/5 items (20%)
